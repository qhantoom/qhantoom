## overview

### fresh syntax

qhantoom's syntax is compact, elegant and cames with nice features. keywords are clear, their use is unique, no doubt about the choice of implementation.

### embedded unit testing

a good way to do unit tests with functionality adapted to the comfort of the programmer. logic and testing in the same file, to change files as little as possible: *very useful when doing tdd.*
