# qhantoom compiler: syntax

defining a relevant syntax that makes semantic sense is not easy. many programming language designers neglect this aspect completely. I have often read and heard that syntax: "who cares". I have a strong focus on design, that's one of the reasons why I don't agree with this kind of statements. my naive vision is probably misleading me. But I think that a syntax must be simple, coherent, intuitive and above all flexible *(a bit like LEGOS).*   

Semantics is the most important thing in a language *(semantic is king)* but design also plays an important role because it's the design that carries the semantics. one can't go without the other, for example it's like making a song by focusing on the content without thinking about the form. It's by doing this that you miss out on a hit or a banger. It is this balance between the two that makes a programming language taste good.    

The syntax of `qhantoom` is intended to be similar to the highway code. It should allow the programmer to write clear instructions. Allowing better distinction and implementation of certain functional paradigms for the uninitiated.   

The idea is that a symbol has only one use depending on its context. This avoids things like: ``` Math.cos(2) === Math.cos`2` ``` returns `true` in `javascript`. Having two different ways of declaring the call of a function is confusing. And that's what I want to avoid with my compiler.    

My syntax choices are focused on the areas of improvement that I have found in some programming languages. These choices are mine alone and are not the way to go.    

## Tokens

**hello world**

```
fun main := () {
  print("hello, world!ðŸ‘½");
}
```

**tokenization**

```
fun
main
:=
(
)
{
print
(
"hello, world!ðŸ‘½"
)
;
}
```

## Comments

`#` - comment line symbol    

`#+` - comment block scope start symbol   
`#-` - comment block scope end symbol

`#!-` - comment block doc scope end symbol    

```
# this is a line comment

#+
